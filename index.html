    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <P>Access to primary healthcare is crucial for the delivery of Kenyaâ€™s universal health coverage policy.However, disparities in healthcare have proved to be the biggest challenge for implementing primary care in poor-urban resource settings. In this study, we assessed the level of access to primary healthcare services and associated factors in urban slums in Nairobi-Kenya.</P>
    <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
    <p>Delivering medical services to the people of the informal settlements in Kenya has been faced by many challenges.Including;</p>

        <li>Burden of preventable medical errors</li>
        <li>A growing population</li>
        <li>An ageing population</li>
    </ol>
        <h1>WHAT THE KENYAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION</h1>
        <h2>ROLE OF KENYAN GOVERNMENT IN HEALTH CARE SUPPORT</h2>
        <p>Governments play a major role in health care financing by mobilizing the necessary resources through public budgets and other contributive mechanisms, pooling resources allocated to health development, guiding the process of resource allocation and purchasing health services from various providers. other than that,the kenyan government is making an effort by;</p>

            <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
            <p>This study shows that access to primary healthcare services for slum residents is poor and it is high time that the government uses the available resources to improve the situation of the most vulnerable members of our community instead of focusing on irrelevant projects.Similarly, public programs that offer protection against out-of-pocket spending are likely to improve access to primary healthcare. In addition, public health facilities need to improve the quality services provided.</p>
